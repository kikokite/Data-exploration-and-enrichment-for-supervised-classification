## Project overview

Data Science has many applications in our daily lives, including in not so obvious areas like in medicine. In this project, we aim to predict the livelihood of patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) using a dataset from the Coimbra Hospital and University Center. This dataset contains information about the patients' lifestyle, medical findings and levels, and overall data that is useful for our goal: finding if the patient is alive in a 1-year period.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to utilize various data cleaning and selection methods, along with different data modeling techniques, to predict patient survival within a one-year period. We will compare these models using different evaluation metrics to determine the most effective approach.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains real patient data from the Coimbra Hospital and University Center. It includes information on the patients' lifestyle, medical findings, and various health metrics.

## Required software and libraries

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
